LUX CAR

1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail ($28 Million)
The British luxury automaker really outdid itself with the stylish new Boat Tail, making it the costliest car. It’s a successor of the Sweptail, another expensive unit from Rolls-Royce. The Boat Tail draws its aesthetics inspiration from the J-Class boats built in the 1920s and 1930s.

2. Rolls-Royce Sweptail
The Rolls-Royce Sweptail was also inspired by early 20th century cars, in addition to classic and modern yachts. It features an interrupted glass roof that runs from the front to the rear of the car. The interior is full of wood and leather decorations.
Under the hood of the Sweptail is a 6.75- liter V12 engine churning out 453 horsepower. The Sweptail is like a yacht on the road with all those features — perhaps that's why it is priced like one. As of 2019, the Sweptail was the most expensive car in the world, until the Bugatti La Voiture Noire overtook it.

3. Mercedes-Maybach Exelero
Like many others before it, the Mercedes-Benz Maybach Exelero is a one-off. Commissioned by Fulda, a German subsidiary of Goodyear, to test its new tires, the Exlero debuted in 2004. Mercedes built the Exelero on the bones of a Maybach, and gave it the same twin-turbo V12 engine producing 690 horsepower (510 kilowatts) and 752 pound-feet (1,020 Newton-meters) of torque. Top speed is listed at 218 miles per hour (350 kilometers per hour) and adjusted for inflation, the Exelero would cost more than $10 million in today's money.




SPORTS CAR

1. Bugatti La Voiture Noire
This unit is no longer the most expensive car today, thanks to the Rolls-Royce Boat Tail. Nonetheless, the Bugatti La Voiture Noire is still a fine piece of engineering. It shares a power unit similar to that in a Chiron, a quad-turbo 8.0-liter W16 engine producing 1,479hp and 1,180lb-ft of torque.
It has a hand-sculpted carbon-fiber shell. Today, the Bugatti La Voiture Noire is the 2nd most expensive car and is owned by 1 person. Initially, the owner bought the car for $12.5 million, but eventually coughed up $18.7 million after taxes.

2. Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta
Zonda was the first car to be produced by Pagani Automobili. Pagani wanted to cease production of the Zonda some years ago, favoring the production of the Huayra. The Italian automaker has since developed several special editions of Zonda cars. The Zonda HP Barchetta has a roofless top and a carbon fibre body. It got its name ‘barchetta’ meaning ‘little boat’ in Italian, since it apparently resembles one.
It is powered by a Mercedes-Benz AMG V12 engine coupled to a 6-speed sequential transmission and a rear-wheel-drive drivetrain. This eye-catching supercar can sprint from 0-60 mph in under 3.4 seconds and won’t stop until it hits a top speed of 220mph. The Italian manufacturer made only three units of the Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta.

3. Bugatti Centodieci ($9 Million)
The Bugatti Centodieci pays homage to the 1991 EB110 supercar, nicknamed ‘centodieci’. The 2019 Bugatti Centodieci is more of a blend between the EB110 and the Bugatti Chiron and celebrates Bugatti’s 110th anniversary. Taking its raw power from the EB110 (most powerful during the ’90s), the new Centodieci generates a heart-pounding 1600hp from its quad-turbo W-16 engine.
With a top speed of 236mph, it may not be the fastest in its category, but this run-of-the-mill Centodieci does the 0-60mph sprint in 2.4 seconds. Only ten units were to hit the roads and have all been claimed.
